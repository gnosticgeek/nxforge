# Changelog

NXForge releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` on `main` ([UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md#versions) has the rules). Each entry lists what NXForge adds on top of [nxnative](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative); upstream's own changes come in through the merges it names.

## Unreleased

- **NXForge Converter:** a finished build clears the Convert page and opens Builds on the new app; an update NSP tagged only by its version (Cyber Shadow) now counts as an update.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-26)

The baseline release: nxnative's main branch as merged on 2026-10-25, plus:

- **Quick settings sidebar** on the Mac (Esc, ⇧⌘G or the Graphics menu; Liquid Glass on macOS 26 and later), with controller and keyboard navigation and remappable keys and buttons per game.
- **Picture filters:** Sharpen, Pixel-perfect, CRT, CRT-Lottes, LCD Grid and scanlines, saved per game.
- **Anisotropic filtering floor** for every game's samplers (`DM_ANISO`), with a per-game row in the sidebar.
- **Cheats:** Atmosphere dmnt cheat codes from Markdown files, one per game build ([docs/cheats.md](docs/cheats.md)).
- **Mods:** RomFS replacement folders per game.
- **Capture:** screenshots (⇧⌘S) and recordings with sound (⇧⌘R).
- **Game folder:** saves, screenshots and recordings beside the game's app.
- **Volume** control in the sidebar.
- **Rumble:** controller vibration handles opened before the controller connects, and a plain Core Haptics player for controllers that refuse the advanced one (8BitDo SN30 Pro).
- **Full screen at 60 fps** on 120 Hz ProMotion displays (no display link while full screen; also sent upstream as seedds/nxnative#194).
- **NXForge Converter:** a SwiftUI Mac app that checks the tools and game files, builds and rebuilds game apps, and shows which engine version each was built on.
- **NXForge name:** bundle IDs `org.nxforge.<title ID>` (Quick settings carried over from the old ID), NOTICE, and the upstream policy.
